      <span id="faq-answer">
      We believe in a Low Carb High Fat diet to enhance weight loss. Under this diet, your carb intake is limited to less than 40 grams of carbs in a day which we monitor precisely by using our own ingredients. Our meals are loaded with healthy fats and lean proteins, along with prebiotics and probiotics to boost digestion and metabolism.
